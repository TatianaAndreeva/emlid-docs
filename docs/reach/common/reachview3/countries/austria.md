# Austria

## Rover Setup

### Coordinate System

Choose a coordinate system based on `MGI (Ferro)` (such as `MGI (Ferro) / Austria East Zone`) or `MGI` (such as `MGI / Austria East`) datums.

### Vertical Datum

Choose one of the available vertical datums:
* `EVRF2000 Austria height`
* `GHA height`

The following geoids are used to perform the transformation:
* `GEOID_GRS80_Oesterreich`
* `GV_Hoehengrid_plus_Geoid_V`

!!! note ""
	For `EVRF2000 Austria height` vertical datum `GEOID_GRS80_Oesterreich` geoid is used, and for `GHA height` `GV_Hoehengrid_plus_Geoid_V2`.

## Base Setup

Your base or NTRIP service should be in `ETRS89`. The following methods are used to perform the datum conversion: `AT_GIS_GRID` grid.

!!! note ""
	You can't use this datum conversion from `ETRS89` to `MGI` or `MGI (Ferro)` for cadastral purposes. It does not comply with the rules for control network tie-in as per Paragraph 3 of the Land Survey Regulations (Vermessungsverordnung) 2010.

When setting up a base station on a benchmark, enter `ETRS89` geographic coordinates (lat/long) and ellipsoidal height in the ReachView 3 *Settings* â‡’ *Base mode* tab.
