## Rover Setup

### Coordinate System

Choose a coordinate system based on `LKS92` datum (such as `LKS92 / Latvia TM`).

### Vertical Datum

Choose one of the available vertical datums: `Latvia 2000 height`.

The following geoids can be used to perform the transformation: `LV_14`.

!!! note ""
	Consider `Latvia 2000 height` vertical datum as `LAS-2000,5 height` in this case.

## Base Setup

Your base or NTRIP service should be in `LKS92`.

!!! note ""
	`LKS92` datum is a national realization of `ETRS89`.

When setting up a base station on a benchmark, enter `LKS92` geographic coordinates (lat/long) and ellipsoidal height in the ReachView 3 *Settings* â‡’ *Base mode* tab.
